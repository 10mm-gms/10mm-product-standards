## ⚖️ Licensing: The "Fair Tools" Policy

10mm is licensed under the **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)**. 

### Why this license?
In the spirit of the 10mm socket—the tool everyone needs but nobody can find—we want this software to be a universal constant in every garage. However, we also want to protect the project from being "colonized" by massive cloud providers who might take our community's hard work and sell it back to you as a closed-off, managed service.

### What this means for you:
* **For Garage Owners:** If you are running 10mm to manage your own physical workshop(s), it is **completely free**. You can modify the code, host it on your own server, and run your business on it without ever paying us a dime.
* **For Contributors:** Your contributions are protected. The code remains source-available, and no one can "close" your improvements behind a proprietary SaaS wall.
* **For Commercial SaaS Providers:** If you wish to sell 10mm as a hosted service (SaaS) to *other* companies, you must obtain a commercial agreement from the 10mm core team.

### The "Open Source" Promise
The BSL is a **delayed open-source license**. On a rolling **5-year basis**, every version of 10mm automatically converts to the **Apache License 2.0**. 

> This ensures that even if the core team disappears, the code will eventually belong to the world as a fully OSI-compliant Open Source project.
